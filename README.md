# Jammming
Use spotify API to search songs and create playlists
## Technologies used
React.js
Sass
FontAwesome
## Features
Users can search for songs by song title, artist's name, album name, or genre

Users can see information about each song such as, title, artist, and album

Users can export their custom playlist to their personal Spotify account
## Installation
You'll need to use npm to install the react-scripts to run or build the project, you'll also need to get a client id from spotify's api and copy it into util/Spotify.js. Currently it is hardcoded until I learn more about OAuth.
